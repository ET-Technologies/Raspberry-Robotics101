# Trains Watch | Cedric_swiss | Raspberry-Robotics101/projects/trainsWatch
(just an example/project not implemented)
A surveillance camera analyzing the trains passing by.

## setup
mounted on fixed support using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, Intel NCS2, USB Webcam, AC-powered, OpenVINO toolkit, ...

* code installation: *explain how to work with the code...*

## current results
It currently outputs the number of trains per day passing by.

## improvements
the ideal goal is to detect what is the train's type (passenger, merchandise, utility).
Can we analyze if a passenger train is empty or full? Same for merchandise type. 
Can we detect technical anomalies on trains? 
Should we analyze further than the train and include the tracks, important side objects?
